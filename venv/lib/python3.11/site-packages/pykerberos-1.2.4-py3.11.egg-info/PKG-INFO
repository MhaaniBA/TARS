This Python package is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations.
The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire Kerberos.framework,
and instead offer a limited set of functions that do what is needed for client/server
Kerberos authentication based on <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.
